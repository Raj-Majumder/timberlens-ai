# TimberLens AI — Multi-Agent Business Intelligence System

> A production multi-agent AI system built for **TimberLens Creations LLC** — a bespoke hardwood guitar stand workshop in Richardson, TX. Designed, built, and validated end-to-end by the business owner as a live testbed for agentic AI architecture.

---

## What it does

TimberLens AI turns a single natural-language prompt into a fully synthesised executive report — drawing on live business data, consulting five specialised AI agents, and optionally delivering the output as a formatted PDF via email.

**Example prompt:**
```
"Do a competitive analysis of guitar stands in my area, send me email with pdf"
```

**What happens:**
1. Live Excel business plan data is synced into shared agent memory
2. Five specialist agents are consulted in parallel (Finance, Supply Chain, Marketing, Master Artisan, Web/Dev)
3. A Manager agent synthesises all inputs into a structured executive report
4. Output is rendered as formatted Markdown — and if requested, saved as a PDF and dispatched by email

### Key components

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `TimberLens_Master.ipynb` | Main orchestrator — runs the full agent pipeline |
| `Skills_Factory.ipynb` | CI layer — syncs and audits all skill files before a run |
| `Skills/Manager.md` | Manager agent persona + synthesis instructions |
| `Skills/Master Artisan.md` | Craft, production, and CAD design expertise |
| `Skills/Finance.md` | COGS, margin, pricing, and financial projection logic |
| `Skills/SupplyChain.md` | Wood sourcing, supplier relationships, logistics |
| `Skills/Marketing.md` | Competitive analysis, positioning, channel strategy |
| `Skills/WebDev.md` | E-commerce, SEO, platform recommendations |
| `Skills/System_State.md` | Auto-generated shared memory — synced from Excel on each run |
| `Context Hub (Chub)` | Local CLI tool — serves verified reference docs to agents on demand via `fetch_hub_docs(doc_id)` |

---

## Data architecture

The system uses a **structured state-sync pattern** as its retrieval layer:

1. On each orchestrator run, `sync_excel_to_state()` reads all 10 sheets from the FY2026 business plan Excel file
2. The full structured data is written to `System_State.md`
3. Every agent call injects both its role-specific persona (from `.md` skill file) and the live business state into the system prompt
4. Agents respond with domain-specific analysis grounded in the actual business numbers

**Live data available to all agents:**

| Excel Sheet | Contents |
|-------------|----------|
| `DASHBOARD` | KPI summary — revenue, margins, targets |
| `PL_Key_Metrics` | Profit & loss projections |
| `COGS_Per_Item` | Per-unit cost breakdown (Walnut: $132.27 / Cherry: $123.40) |
| `Wood_Sourcing` | Supplier details and lead times |
| `Wood_Cost` | Board-foot pricing and consumption per unit |
| `Labor` | Labor rate ($26.67/hr), time per unit (1.83 hrs) |
| `Consumables_Others` | Finish, hardware, consumable costs |
| `Business_Details` | Company info, pricing ($350 Walnut / $325 Cherry) |
| `Equipment_List` | Tools and capital equipment inventory |
| `Log` | Production and sales activity log |

## Context Hub (Chub) — long-term reference library

The Context Hub solves a specific problem that arises in multi-agent systems: **agents hallucinating technical details or business rules** when that knowledge isn't in their immediate context.

### The problem it solves

`System_State.md` provides live *operational* data (financials, costs, inventory). But agents also need access to stable *reference* knowledge — wood species specifications, finishing technique documentation, joinery standards, supplier terms, business rules — information that doesn't change run-to-run but is too large to inject into every prompt.

Without a solution, agents either guess (hallucinate) or give generic answers. Chub gives them a way to fetch the exact document they need, exactly when they need it.

### How it works

A local CLI tool (`chub`) manages a curated library of verified reference documents. Any agent skill file (e.g. `WebDev.md`, `Master Artisan.md`) can call the bridge function at inference time:

```python
def fetch_hub_docs(doc_id):
    """Fetches clean docs from the Hub without cluttering the notebook."""
    result = subprocess.run(['chub', 'get', doc_id, '--lang', 'py'],
                            capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout if result.returncode == 0 else "Doc not found."
```

The agent receives the retrieved document as additional context and grounds its response in verified content rather than parametric memory.

### Two-layer memory architecture

| Layer | Source | Type | Updates |
|-------|--------|------|---------|
| `System_State.md` | Excel business plan | Live operational data | Every orchestrator run |
| Context Hub (Chub) | Curated doc library | Stable reference knowledge | Manually, when docs change |

This separation keeps the system prompt lean — agents pull reference docs only when their task requires them — while ensuring responses are always grounded in verified business and technical knowledge.

### Prerequisites for Chub

The Context Hub Bridge requires the `chub` CLI to be installed locally. If not present, `fetch_hub_docs()` returns a graceful fallback:
```
"Chub CLI not installed. Run API_Setup.ipynb first."
```

## Sample output

The system has successfully generated:

- **Competitive market analysis** — 11-section executive report with market segmentation, competitor threat matrix, SWOT, pricing map, and prioritised recommendations with ROI projections
- **Financial scenario modelling** — multi-initiative impact tables with projected revenue lift ($61,500 → $98,500) and per-initiative ROI
- **Supply chain assessments** — wood sourcing optimisation against live cost and supplier data
- **Strategic roadmaps** — quarterly action plans with owner assignment and expected impact

---

## Tech stack

- **Language:** Python 3.12
- **AI:** Anthropic API (`claude-opus-4-6`) via `anthropic` Python SDK
- **Data:** `pandas` for Excel ingestion; structured Markdown for agent memory
- **Reference library:** Context Hub (`chub`) CLI — on-demand verified doc retrieval for agents
- **Output:** `fpdf` for PDF generation; `smtplib` for email dispatch; `markdown` for HTML rendering
- **Environment:** JupyterLab (Anaconda) — desktop app migration in progress

## Known limitations and upgrade roadmap

This system is a validated proof of concept. The following limitations are understood and inform the next development phase:

**Current limitations:**

| Limitation | Impact | Planned fix |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Brute-force context injection | All 10 Excel sheets injected into every agent call regardless of relevance — inefficient token usage | Replace with ChromaDB vector retrieval; each agent retrieves only relevant sheets/rows |
| No unstructured document support | System can only reason over structured Excel data | Add LangChain document ingestion pipeline for PDFs, emails, supplier quotes |
| Hardcoded local file paths | Not portable across machines | Refactor to relative paths + `.env` config file |
| Jupyter-only rendering | `display(Markdown())` is Jupyter-specific | Abstract output layer for desktop UI migration |
| No agent output evaluation | No automated quality scoring on generated reports | Integrate RAGAS-style faithfulness and relevancy metrics |

**Next phase — desktop app + true RAG:**
- Refactor orchestrator into standalone Python module (`timberlens_core.py`)
- Replace `System_State.md` inject with per-agent ChromaDB semantic retrieval
- Add LangChain document pipeline for unstructured business documents
- Package as desktop app (Tkinter or Electron wrapper)
- Add conversation history so the system supports follow-up queries

## Setup

### Prerequisites
```
Python 3.12+
Anthropic API key
```

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/timberlens-ai.git
cd timberlens-ai
pip install anthropic pandas fpdf markdown python-dotenv
```

### Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
EXCEL_FILE_PATH=/path/to/your/TimberLens_Business_Plan_FY2026.xlsx
SKILLS_PATH=/path/to/your/Skills/
```

> **Security note:** Never commit your `.env` file or API key to version control. The `.gitignore` in this repo excludes `.env` and all `.rtf` credential files.

### Running
1. Run `Skills_Factory.ipynb` first — confirms all 8 skill files are present and synced
2. Open `TimberLens_Master.ipynb`
3. Run all cells in order (System Configurator → Email/PDF Generator → Orchestrator Engine)
4. Edit the `user_request` string in the Command Console cell and run
